# mock-logger-examples

Examples of testing different Loggers, with various permutations ofJUnit, Mockito, and PowerMock frameworks.

Note: I would prefer to use the [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/index) Matchers in the unit tests. However,
it would complicate the POMs, and I just want to keep the most stripped-down examples here.
